// ANNOTATION: A general outline of the query file is that it is a collection of all the queries that just get (and not change) data
// The actual code for the database queries live in the resolvers.js file, but this file appears to act as a middleman between our frontend and those queries
// and directs the requests to the proper function in resolvers. Maybe could look at this file like a controller in rails
